the Project Front End file stores the front end section while the Project Back End file stores the back end

To run front end go to project directory and run `npm i` to download all the modules needed for the project, once downloaded run `npm start`

To run back end you can either run the source code, create the docker-compose container and run or run in kubernetes cluster.

Make sure that when running the backend, the service's database is within the host mysql database and the username and password of the pom.xml is changed to the host machine's mysql credentials
